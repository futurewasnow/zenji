Our Story

The Beginning

[Zenji](http://www.ojodelatigra.com/) [started in Costa Rica in 2020 with a group\\
\\
of card game enthusiasts who wanted to share\\
\\
their love of play with others. Starting with just a\\
\\
few home games, we slowly grew into a thriving\\
\\
gaming community with a love for games and\\
\\
jungle fun! Now, after many years of playing\\
\\
Zenji at our farm](http://www.ojodelatigra.com/) [‘Ojo de La Tigra’](http://www.ojodelatigra.com/) [, we are ready\\
\\
to share this creation with the rest of the world!](http://www.ojodelatigra.com/)

![](https://playzenji.com/_assets/media/ec29cba32013e390372226e06da347ff.png)

The Vision

We believe that games are more than just

a pastime—they're like magic portals to

connect with others, learn new skills, and

bring loads of fun! We are committed to

providing other players worldwide with

high-quality, mindful games, and to

promoting the benefits of games to people

of all ages and backgrounds. Let's play!

The "Journey of Remembering" in Zenji is about strategically managing one's Monkey Mind, accumulating Elemental Points, and outsmarting opponents. Through careful card selection, calculated risks, and mindful decisions, players strive to clear their minds and achieve Zen mastery.

Always guided by four mystical allies, the avatars of

AIR, EARTH, WATER and FIRE!

TIPS for new players:

Make sure you have your

REFERENCE CARDS close

to you during your first

Zenji rounds!

The players with LESS monkey points in their monkey mind

will score MOREelemental points from the higher mind.

Zenji has one golden rule:

Zenji Rules and Gameplay

Zenji’s Objective :

The first player to score

15 ELEMENTAL POINTS

wins the game!

‘’ LESS IS MORE ‘’

[REMEMBER TO WATCH](https://playzenji.com/#page-4)

[THE INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO](https://playzenji.com/#page-4)

[HERE BELOW!](https://playzenji.com/#page-4)

A RULE book is also included in the ZENJI game box.

You can download a COPY of the rules on your phone!

More languages will be added soon.

Zenji is a card game for 2-4 players where the goal is to become

the Zen master by collecting Elemental Points (EP). The game

utilizes a unique “Monkey Mind” and “Higher Mind” mechanic

where players aim to minimize points in their “Monkey Mind” to

transfer EP cards to their scorecard from their “Higher Mind.”

1.Go easy on the beginner’s mind

We recommend playing your first rounds of

Zenji withjust the starter’s deck (61 cards).

2\. Ready for the next level ?

Learn about the 20 expansion cards and introduce

them one by one to your game! Master all the

powers and soon you can challenge other ZEN-

masters to play with the complete deck (81 cards)!

Experience the infinite ‘mind-magic’ of Zenji!

3\. Zenji is a 2-4 player game

For kids and adults of ages 9-99

Playing with 2 players is faster and more strategic.

It’s ideal for mastering all the Zenji skills!

Playing with 3-4 people might require

extra luck, but your memory skills and

ability to stay focused will be tested more.

And, more people = more fun!

4\. PRO tip:

2-player games are also best for the

‘Zenji Pro’ experience with collectibles!

Challenge another experienced Zenji player

to test your Zenji skills and gain more STAR

collectibles for your personal card collection!
